# CKO Frontend Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create a customer feedback page that allows customers to :

- Write a review for a product (name, email, rating 1 to 5 stars and a ‘comment’
  section).
- See all the comments for the product.
- See a chart showing the trends (you can use any library available for charting).

---

## Prerequisite

`yarn >= 1.22.5`

## Usage

To launch the app locally, run

```
yarn && yarn start
```

The app should be available on `localhost:3000`.

Running unit tests:

```
yarn test
```

Running cypress tests:

```
yarn cypress
```

To export metrics, pass a function to reportWebVitals in index.js, eg.

```
reportWebVitals(console.log);
```

## Technology

The requirement of the challenge is to create the app with React. I've used Create React App to create a skeleton for a basic react app. Most components are created as functional components with hooks.

For styling, I've chosen to experiment with `styled-components` as it is the choice of technology at Checkout and I'd like to familiarise myself with it. Having used both css modules and css-in-js, I think the greatest advantage of css-in-js solutions is the ability to pass props into styled components, which usually results in a lot of boilerplate in css modules. All styles in this app are stored in a theme object which is referenced by all styled components, in a similar manner to tokens in a Design System.

For unit testing, I've also chosen to experiment with a new technology, `React Testing Library` encourages you to write tests in a way that is more representative of the user's experience. I've written a couple integration tests using `Cypress` to cover the happy path of the interaction.

My choice of technology for the graph is `recharts`. Having looked at several React charting libraries, recharts has the greatest number of stars and hence community support around it. Moreover, it has good documentation and is maintained regularly.

## Features

- A form featuring 4 fields, name, email, rating and comment.
- Form can be interacted with using keyboard and accessibility is tested using mac voiceover.
- Form will only be submitted if all fields have been filled in.
- Submitting a comment will update the latest comments section and the summary graph without reloading the page
- Local storage: Submitted comments will persist locally on page reload.

## Improvements

- Include reset.css to have more control over overall styling, however due to time constraints I felt like I benefitted from leveraging browser default styling.
- Add pagination for comments to show a maximum of 10 - 15 comments per page.
- Improve validation for email. Real email validation can be complex and I feel that it's out of scope for this project.
- Add support for TypeScript. As I am already trying to 2 new technologies I felt that it may be too risky to add another technology I've not got much experience with.
- Improve accessibility of chart. It is not currently possible to add labels to svgs generated by recharts. However, visually hidden texts could be added to describe the data for screen reader users.
- We can show trends of ratings by allowing filtering by date range, eg. ratings in the past 6 months, or by displaying an average rating over time.
- Accomodating to scale: If this app were to be extended, I would move the Customer Feedback Page into a component instead of the main app, as well as form components into the main components scope so they can be shared across multiple forms or pages. I would move away from Create React App as we can have more control over tooling.
- i18n: Currently all lang are hardcoded, if the app were to support multiple languages, lang files containing a mapping to each text content would be preferred.
