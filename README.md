# CKO Frontend Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create a customer feedback page that allows customers to :

- Write a review for a product (name, email, rating 1 to 5 stars and a ‘comment’
  section).
- See all the comments for the product.
- See a chart showing the trends (you can use any library available for charting).

---

## Technology

The requirement of the challenge is to create the app with React. I've used Create React App to create a skeleton for a basic react app. Most components are created as functional components with hooks.

For styling, I've chosen to experiment with `styled-components` as it is the choice of technology at Checkout and I'd like to familiarise myself with it. All styles are stored in a theme object which is referenced by all styled components, in a similar manner to tokens in a Design System.

For unit testing, I've also chosen to experiment with a new technology, `React Testing Library` as it is more representative of the user's experience.

My choice of technology for the graph is `recharts`. It has React support, good documentation and is maintained regularly.

## Features

- Form validation: Name, email, rating and comment are required for the feedback to be submitted.
- Local storage: Submitted comments will persist locally on page reload.

## Usage

To launch the app locally, run

```
yarn && yarn start
```

The app should be available on `localhost:3000`.

## Improvements

- Include reset.css to have more control over overall styling, however due to time constraints I felt like I benefitted from leveraging browser default styling.
- Add pagination for comments to show a maximum of 10 - 15 comments per page.
- Add support for TypeScript. As I am already trying to 2 new technologies I felt that it may be too risky to add another technology I've not got much experience with.
- Improve accessibility of chart. It is not currently possible to add labels to svgs generated by recharts. However, visually hidden texts could be added to describe the data for screen reader users.
- We can show trends of ratings by allowing filtering by date range, eg. ratings in the past 6 months, or by displaying an average rating over time.
