# CKO Frontend Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to create a customer feedback page that allows customers to : 
- Write a review for a product (name, email, rating 1 to 5 stars and a ‘comment’
section).
- See all the comments for the product.
- See a chart showing the trends (you can use any library available for charting).
---

## Technology 

The requirement of the challenge is to create the app with React. I've used Create React App to create a skeleton for a basic react app. 



## Usage

To launch the app locally, run 
```
yarn && yarn start
```

The app should be available on `localhost:3000`.
